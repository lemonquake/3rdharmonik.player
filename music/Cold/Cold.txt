Cold - 3rd Harmonik

[Verse]
The cold came earlier,
We didn't expect that,
I was very close, that I could never forget,
The sacrifices that we have made,
The sleepless nights and the endless days,
You make it worthwhile,
Ohhh..

[Chorus]
The world is unfair,
There's more to bare..
Please, don't let it go,
You don't let it show,
That's the hard part,
Ohh, that's the hard part,
I swear everything will change,
Because this is our main stage,
Oh, this is our, this is our main stage..

[Verse 2]
Now the show starts,
Didn't forget that,
We were so close,
Wish you'd remember,
The sacrifices,
That we have made,
The rainy nights and,
The endless sun,
You make it worthwhile,
Ohhh..

[Chorus]
The world is unfair,
There's more to bare..
Please, don't let it go,
You don't let it show,
That's the hard part,
Ohh, that's the hard part,
I swear everything will change,
Because this is our main stage,
Oh, this is our, this is our main stage..

[Verse 3]
Now that we're in the lights,
Don't stop the show,
Don't let the cold come,
'Coz we were just,
Just getting hot,
Wish you'd never stop,
'Coz You make it worthwhile,
Ohhh..

[Chorus]
The world is unfair,
There's more to bare..
Please, don't let it go,
You don't let it show,
That's the hard part,
Ohh, that's the hard part,
I swear everything will change,
Because this is our main stage,
Oh, this is our, this is our main stage..

This is our main stage,
Oh, this is our, this is our main stage..
Yeah.. ohhh...

[Final]
The world's so unfair,
No more left to bare..
Please, don't let me go,
You don't let it show,
That's the hard part,
Ohh, that's the hard part,
I swear everything can change,
Because this is our main stage,
Oh, this is our, this is our main stage..
Ohhh.. our main stage..
Ohh.. This is our, this is our main stage..
