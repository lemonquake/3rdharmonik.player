How Could You - 3rd Harmonik

[Verse]
How could you?
Split my heart in two,
How could you,
Have made yourself weak,
Now I'm turnin' into,
Something I'm not,
So you mean that,
You made me believe,
That you were weak,
The entire time.. ohh..

Honestly, I cared for you,
Actually, you know it's true,
That deep down this darkness,
It's brighten up by you,

[Chorus]
You taught me how to understand,
Now, you shattered my peace,
I can't hate  you now,
Would you tell me how?
How could you, my love?
How could you.... ohh...

[Verse]
I don't believe you,
I know that's not it,
Why won't you say something?
How could you,
Have made yourself weak,
The entire time,
Made me believe,
That there could be something,
But what is this feeling? Ohh..

Honestly, I cared for you,
Actually, you know it's true,
That deep down this darkness,
It's brighten up by you,

[Chorus]
You taught me how to understand,
Now, you shattered my peace,
I can't hate you now,
Would you tell me how?
How could you, my love?
How could you.... ohh...

[Bridge]
How could you, my love?
How could you.... ohh...
How could you, my love?
How could you.... ohh...

[Chorus]
You taught me how to understand,
Now, you shattered my peace,
I can't hate you now,
Would you tell me how?
How could you, my love?
How could you.... ohh...

How could you, my love?

[Final]
How could you, my love?
How could you.... ohh...
How could you, my love?
How could you.... ohh...
How could you, my love?
How could you.... ohh...
How could you, my love?
How could you.... ohh...
