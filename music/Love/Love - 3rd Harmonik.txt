[Verse 1]
What is love?
Yeah, I'll tell you,
Might sound clichè, mind you,
Here's the thing, listen..
You don't get to choose,
Because love chooses,
Defies logic. One loses,
Their minds over it, to get over it.

[Refrain]
It's like you're losing a winning game,
But that's no shame..

[Chorus]
In other words, in other worlds,
I'd still choose you, over and over,
Twice on Sundays, ten out of ten,
Ohh.. don't need to pretend,
That in other words, I love you,
And in other worlds, I'll tell you,
It won't be easy to forget,
'Coz I'll be having no regrets,
Ohh.. love.

[Verse 2]
How to love?
Yeah, I'll tell you,
Might sound corny, mind you,
I know I sound overdramatic,
But there's no perfect,
You just gotta do,
What you have to do. Nothing cryptic,
Don't overcomplicate the already complicated.

[Refrain]
Ohh.. It's like you're losing a winning game,
But that's no shame, 'coz..


[Chorus]
In other words, in other worlds,
I'd still choose you, over and over,
Twice on Sundays, ten out of ten,
Ohh.. don't need to pretend,
That in other words, I love you,
And in other worlds, I'll tell you,
It won't be easy to forget,
'Coz I'll be having no regrets,
Ohh.. love..
Ohh.. love..

[Bridge]
If you find yourself in a pinch,
Don't you ever regret,
You'll learn the most from the toughest lessons,
And if you ever find yourself back to square one,
Well.. don't stop. "You know what to do now, right??"

[Chorus]
In other words, in other worlds,
I'd still choose you, over and over,
Twice on Sundays, ten out of ten,
Ohh.. don't need to pretend...

[Chorus]
In other words, in other worlds,
I'd still choose you, over and over,
Twice on Sundays, ten out of ten,
Ohh.. don't need to pretend,
That in other words, I love you,
And in other worlds, I'll tell you,
It won't be easy to forget,
'Coz I'll be having no regrets,
Ohh.. love,
Ohh.. love,
Ohh.. love,
Ohh.. is this what love is?
Ohh.. love..
