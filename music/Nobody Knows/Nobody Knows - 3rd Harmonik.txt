Nobody Knows - 3rd Harmonik

[Verse 1]
Do you believe,
In destiny?
One melody,
Is all you need,
All too familiar,
This rainy night,
Hold on tight,
You're safe with me..

[Chorus]
And time just slows down, 
and nobody knows,
Just, you and me,
The way that our eyes,
Meet, like they know,
Each other from,
A long time ago,
And nobody knows,
Just how this goes,
Ohh.. nobody knows, yeah..
Nobody knows..

[Verse 2]
Do you believe,
In miracles?
Just one day,
Is all we need,
Nothing similar,
This cloudy day,
Cold night ahead,
You'll be safe with me..

[Chorus]
And time just slows down, 
and nobody knows,
Just, you and me,
The way that our eyes,
Meet, like they know,
Each other from,
A long time ago,
And nobody knows,
Just how this goes,
Ohh.. nobody knows, yeah..
Nobody knows..

[Bridge]
Nah, nah, nah, nah..
Nobody knows..
Nah, nah, nah, nah..
Only you..

And time just slows,
Down, and nobody knows...

[Chorus]
And time just slows down, 
and nobody knows,
Just, you and me,
The way that our eyes,
Meet, like they know,
Each other from,
A long time ago,
And nobody knows,
Just how this goes,
Ohh.. nobody knows, yeah..
Nobody knows..

[Final]
And time just slows,
Down, and nobody knows,
Just, you and me,
The way it flows,
Just like no other,
There is no other,
It's you and me,
And nobody knows,
Just how this goes,
Ohh.. nobody knows, yeah..
Nobody knows..

Nah, nah, nah, nah..
Nobody knows..
Nah, nah, nah, nah..
Only you..
