Obvious - 3rd Harmonik

Intro: D - G - Em-A - D (2x)

[Verse]
D
Can we talk,
        
        G
for a little more while?

Bm             A
I can't get enough of it, 

G
your voice, your smile,

D
Think I'm addicted, 

G
it's so complicated,

Bm         A
Getting disoriented,

     G
It's at the tip,
of my tongue,
But I can't let it out..

D
How long do I have to,

G
Hide this feeling,

Bm             A
This obvious grinning,

G
I'm still believing..

[Chorus]
D
I'm sorry 'coz I love you now,

G
Can't quite figure it out,

Em       A
How to show you,

G
How to say it, how to prove it,

D
I'm sorry I have to tell you,

       G
This hopeless feeling,

            Em     A
That I am clinging,

      G
To a dying hope,
I pray.. that you would say..

D - G - Em-A - D

I can't get enough of it,

your scent, your style,

D
Think I'm addicted,

it's so complicated,

Getting disoriented,

     G
It's at the tip,
of my tongue,

[Bridge]
Bm        A
It's obvious, I know,

G
But I want to show,

              Bm
I can't lie low,

         A
This is embarrassing,

    G
But I'm getting,
The feeling,

                  Bm
That you somehow smiled,
         A    G
Is it obvious?

A
Obvious..

D
I'm sorry 'coz I loved you now,

G
Can't quite figure it how,

Em       A
How to show you,

G
How to say it, how to prove it,

D
I'm sorry I have to tell you,

       G
This hopeless feeling,

            Em     A
That I am clinging,

      G
To a dying hope,
I pray.. that you would say..
