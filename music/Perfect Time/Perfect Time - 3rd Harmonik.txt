Perfect Time - 3rd Harmonik

[Verse 1]
Staring all day at the cieling,
Remembering all the lingering pain,
I still read the conversations,
Where we were so curious, and you were so mysterious,

The time is perfect,
It's Sunday, and I hear our songs on the radio,
Almost fell asleep,
Thinking about this way too deep.

[Refrain]
What I would give just to have it with you,
What I would give just to be with you..

[Chorus]
Oh.. one day we'll know,
Someday it will show,
No need to rush, let it ride,
Don't let it die, let it fly,
'Coz all we need is trust,
That's all we need tonight,
Ohh.. tonight,
All we need is,
Ohh.. tonight..

[Verse 2]
Waiting all day for your message,
Just thinking 'bout how things could have gone south,
But I read the conversations,
Where we were so dramatic, it's funny 'coz we always get by,
Yeah.. we always get by, ohh..

[Refrain]
What I would give just to have it with you,
What I would give just to be with you..

[Chorus]
Oh.. one day we'll know,
Someday it will show,
No need to rush, let it ride,
Don't let it die, let it fly,
'Coz all we need is trust,
That's all we need tonight,
Ohh.. tonight,
All we need is,
Ohh.. tonight..

[Bridge]
No one could ever, ever have,
The things that they really, really want,
But it's the perfect time to say,
I need to hear you say,
That I need you.. today, and tonight..
Ohhh.. all we need is, tonight..
Ohhh.. all we need is, tonight..

[Chorus]
Oh.. one day we'll know,
Someday it will show,
No need to rush, let it ride,
Don't let it die, let it fly,
'Coz all we need is trust,
That's all we need tonight,
Ohh.. tonight,
All we need is,
Ohh.. tonight..

That's all we need tonight,
Ohh.. tonight,
All we need is,
Ohh.. tonight..
