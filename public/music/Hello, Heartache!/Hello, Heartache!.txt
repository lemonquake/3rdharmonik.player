Hello, Heartache! - 3rd Harmonik

[Verse 1]  
Watching from afar,  
It's hard to believe,  
Your beauty's so vivid,  
It's like a dream,  
I'm drawn to your essence,  
So effortlessly,  
Pardon my gaze,  
But you're all that I see,

Your laughter’s like music,  
It plays in my mind,  
A tune so flawless,  
It's one of a kind,  
Your smile lights the room,  
In a way so fine,  
Enthralled by your presence,  
In every single line,

[Refrain]  
You're always on my mind, ohh...  
I can't think clearly...  

[Chorus]  
Hello, heartache!
It's me once more,
Wishing this time,
She’d notice me,
Oh, the irony!
I feel I might break,
If she looks my way,
I might just fade,
Hello, heartache!
It's you again,
Wishing this time,
It will never end,
Forgive me but, I must turn away,
Damn... damn... guess I have to turn away,

[Verse 2]  
Every step you take,  
Is like a dance so sweet,  
Your grace and charm,  
Make my heart skip a beat,  
Your eyes like stars,  
In a sky so deep,  
I get lost in their shine,  
And I don't even mind,

The way you brush your hair,  
Behind your ear so neat,  
Makes my heart race,  
Every time we meet,  
Your voice is a whisper,  
In a gentle breeze,  
It soothes my restless soul,  
And puts my mind at ease,

[Refrain]  
You're always on my mind, ohh...  
I can't think clearly...  

[Chorus]  
Hello, heartache!
It's me once more,
Wishing this time,
She’d notice me,
Oh, the irony!
I feel I might break,
If she looks my way,
I might just fade,
Hello, heartache!
It's you again,
Wishing this time,
It will never end,
Forgive me but, I must turn away,
Damn... damn... guess I have to turn away,

[Bridge]  
Will I find the courage,  
To let you know?  
Or am I bound,  
To let these feelings grow?  
In this world of light,  
Where hope feels strong,  
I keep believing,  
That with you I belong,

[Refrain]
You're always on my mind, ohh...
I can't think clearly...

[Chorus]
Hello, heartache!
It's me once more,
Wishing this time,
She’d notice me,
Oh, the irony!
I feel I might break,
If she looks my way,
I might just fade,

[Final]  
Hello, heartache!
It's me once more,
Wishing this time,
She’d notice me,
Oh, the irony!
I feel I might break,
If she looks my way,
I might just fade,
Hello, heartache!
It's you again,
Wishing this time,
It will never end,
Forgive me but, I must turn away,
Damn... damn... guess I have to turn away,

[Outro]
Watching from afar,
It's hard to believe,
Your beauty's so vivid,
It's like a dream,
I'm drawn to your essence,
So effortlessly,
Pardon my gaze,
But you're all that I see..
