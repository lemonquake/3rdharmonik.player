[Hook]
La, la, la..
La, la, la..
La, la, la..
La, la, la..

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry when,
I disappeared,
When we needed it the most,
I couldn't hurt you any longer,
There's no excuse, although I used,
The last of my strength,
Just to hold it together,
I'm sorry, if..

[Refrain]
It hurts more than it helps,
If only we can,

[Chorus]
I guess we'll never know,
How would our love grow,
I guess we'll never know,
How we could get by, no,
I can't get out of this misery,
It's so much for me,
And too much for you,
But both could never throw,
I guess we'll never know..
Ohh.. we'll never know..

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry when,
I got used to it,
You needed me to be strong,
I did, but I did so wrong,
Not knowing, I was coping,
And I was hoping,
To hold you longer,
I'm sorry, if..

[Refrain]
It hurts more than it helps,
If only we can,

[Chorus]
I guess we'll never know,
How would our love grow,
I guess we'll never know,
How we could get by, no,
I can't get out of this misery,
It's so much for me,
And too much for you,
But both could never throw,
I guess we'll never know..
Ohh.. we'll never know..

[Bridge]
Our hearts we're broken from the start,
All these lies, and the deceptions,
We're breaking us apart,
If we can be honest and forgive,
Give more so we could live,
Our lives not wanting more,
We always wanted more..

[Chorus]
I guess we'll never know,
How would our love grow...

[Chorus higher key]
I guess we'll never know,
How would our love grow,
I guess we'll never know,
How we could get by, no,
I can't get out of this misery,
It's so much for me,
And too much for you,
But both could never throw,

I guess we'll never know..
Ohh.. we'll never know..

[Hook]
La, la, la..
La, la, la..
La, la, la..
La, la, la..

I guess we'll never know..
Ohh.. we'll never know..
Ohh..
