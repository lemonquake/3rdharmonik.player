My Beautiful Disaster - 3rd Harmonik

[Verse 1]
I didn't think it would end this way,
My hopeful mind, it's beginning to sway,
I came across a,
Beautiful disaster, a pretty mess, oh, so gangster,
I didn't think that we would start it off,
A simple glance, and when you look my way,
I feel like it's,
A heavy-hitting blaster, it's not a miss, oh, please don't stare..

[Refrain]
Found myself in a swirl,
And, you know what?

[Chorus]
Never will I,
Ever will,
Forever, should,
I ever think,
Of disgracing myself, by saying that,
It's all too easy, just by loving you,
I never should, or ever would,
Be hoping that,
You will look easily,
Because you,
You're extra special, you..

[Verse 2]
I always hoped it would end this way,
Oh.. my colorful mind, it's beginning to dream,
I came across a,
Beautiful disaster, a neverending kiss, yeah, she's so gangster,
I always hoped that I could talk to you,
A simple conversation.. don't mind my admiration,
'Coz for sure, it's,
Truly something different, it's what I meant, oh, how it would go..

[Refrain]
Found myself in a swirl,
And, you know what?

[Chorus]
Never will I,
Ever will,
Forever, should,
I ever think,
Of disgracing myself, by saying that,
It's all too easy, just by loving you,
I never should, or ever would,
Be hoping that,
You will look easily,
Because you,
You're extra special, you..

[Bridge]
A beautiful disaster,
It's always more painful to fall,
If your dreams are this tall,
A hope for everafter,
It's more difficult in here,
You don't wanna disappear..

[Chorus]
Never will I,
Ever will,
Forever, should,
I ever think,
Of disgracing myself, by saying that,
It's all too easy, just by loving you,
I never should, or ever would,
Be hoping that,
You will look easily,
Because you,
You're extra special, you..

[Chorus]
Never will I,
Ever will,
Forever, should,
I ever think,
Of disgracing myself, by saying that,
It's all too easy, just by loving you,
I never should, or ever would,
Be hoping that,
You will look easily,
Because you,
You're extra special, you..
You're extra special, you..
My beautiful disaster, you..
My happy everafter, you..
