Obvious - 3rd Harmonik

[Verse 1]
Can we talk,
for a little more while?
Can't get enough of it, 
your voice, your smile,
Think I'm addicted, 
it's so complicated,
Getting disoriented,
It's at the tip,
of my tongue,
But I can't let it out..

How long do I have to,
Hide this feeling,
This obvious grinning,
I'm still believing..

[Chorus]
I'm sorry 'coz I love you now,
Can't quite figure it out,
How to show you,
How to say it, how to prove it,
I'm sorry I have to tell you,
This hopeless feeling,
That I am clinging,
To a dying hope,
I pray.. that you would say..

[Verse 2]
Can we walk, 
for a little more while?
Can't get enough of it, 
your scent, your style,
Think I'm addicted, 
it's so complicated,
Getting disoriented,
It's at the tip,
of my tongue,
But I can't let it out..

How long do I have to,
Hide this feeling,
This obvious grinning,
I'm still believing..

[Chorus]
I'm sorry 'coz I love you now,
Can't quite figure it out,
How to show you,
How to say it, how to prove it,
I'm sorry I have to tell you,
This hopeless feeling,
That I am clinging,
To a dying hope,
I pray.. that you would say..

[Bridge]
It's obvious, I know,
But I want to show,
I can't lie low,
This is embarrassing,
But I'm getting,
The feeling,
That you somehow smiled,
Is it obvious?
Obvious..
Obvious..
Obvious..
Obvious..

I'm sorry 'coz I love you now,
Can't quite figure it out,
How to show you,
How to say it, how to prove it,

[Chorus]
I'm sorry 'coz I love you now,
Can't quite figure it out,
How to show you,
How to say it, how to prove it,
I'm sorry I have to tell you,
This hopeless feeling,
That I am clinging,
To a dying hope,
I pray.. that you would say..

Is it obvious?
Obvious..

Is it obvious?
Obvious..

Is it obvious?
Obvious..

Is it obvious?
Obvious..
