Undo - 3rd Harmonik

Ohh..

[Verse 1]
I don't have much to say,
You're leaving anyway,
What can I do to make you stay?
Don't know when's the right time and this broken heart of mine,
Is bleeding so much that I can't undo what's done,

[Pre-chorus]
I do apologize,
You know I realize,

[Chorus]
You walked out of my life,
If I can just make it right,
But what is it to fight when it's all in broken pieces?
And the pain, it hurts just like a knife,
If I can just hold you tight,
I will hold you till forever,
..why am I too late? Ohh..
Why was I too late?
Why was I too late?

[Verse 2]
What's done is done,
You're leaving anyway,
What can I do to change the way, that I said the things that make you think that I don't care?
I have learned so much,
And I can't undo what's done..

[Chorus]
You walked out of my life,
If I can just make it right,
But what is it to fight when it's all in broken pieces?
And the pain, it hurts just like a knife,
If I can just hold you tight,
I will hold you till forever,
..why am I too late? Ohh..
Why was I too late?
Why was I too late?

[Chorus 2]
You walked out of my life,
If I can just make it right,
But what is it to fight when it's all in broken pieces?
And the pain, it hurts just like a knife,
If I can just hold you tight,
I will hold you till forever,
..why am I too late? Ohh..
Why was I too late?
Why was I too late?

[Final]
You walked out of my life,
If I can just make it right,
But what is it to fight when it's all in broken pieces?
And the pain, it hurts just like a knife,
If I can just hold you tight,
I will hold you till forever,
..why am I too late? Ohh..
Why was I too late?
Why was I too late?
